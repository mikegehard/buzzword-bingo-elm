# An Introduction to [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

1. What is Elm? 

    * "the best of functional programming in your browser"
    * [senior thesis](http://elm-lang.org/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf) 
    from [Evan Czaplicki](https://twitter.com/czaplic) who currently
    works at Prezi using Elm.

2. Why Elm?

    * High level framework for dealing with complex graphical layouts
    * Concurrent [Functional Reactive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) 
        * Declartive way to create systems that react to events.
        * Programming focuses on what is displayed, runtime focues on how it is displayed
        * Helps reduce complexity of programming GUIs.
        * Concurrency increases GUI responsiveness
        * [Thesis](http://elm-lang.org/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf) is a great read on the background of Elm.

3. [Elm features](http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax)

    * Repl (elm repl)
    * Records - think JavaScript objects but they are immutable and have a type signature

    ```
    type alias Person = { name: String, age: Int}
    mike = {name = "Mike", age = 42}
    changeAge person newAge = {person | age <- newAge}
    changeAge mike 43
    ```

    * Type inference and static typing
    * Pure functions
    * Algabraic Data Types (aka Tagged Unions)
    * Syntax is a mix of Haskell and F#
    * [Community contributed packages](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages)
    * [FRP constructs](http://elm-lang.org/guide/reactivity)
        * Signal - stream of values that can be manipulated via core logic
        * Task - model for asnyc operations that can fail
        * Signals model incoming data, Tasks model outgoing data. Like monads that they
            put all state mutation outside of pure functions.
        * All are handled by the runtime and not the developer
        * Still wrapping my head around these concepts and how to use them to do things
            like HTTP calls.
    * [Javascript interop](http://elm-lang.org/guide/interop)

4. Testing via [Elm-test](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-elm-test)

    * Haven't gotten around to looking into this yet.

5. [Elm Browser Application Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)

    ```
    Very similar to Flux/React in that is has a one way data flow.

    Flux

    Action(Data) --> Dispatcher --> Store --> View(VirtualDom) --
                           ^                                     |
                           |                                     |
                           |                                     |
                            -------------- Action(Data)----------

    Elm

    Action(Data) --> StartApp/Global Event Dispatcher --> Update/Model --> View(VirtualDom) --
                           ^                                                     |
                           |                                                     |
                           |                                                     |
                            --------------------- Action(Data)-------------------
    ```

6. Code and a [running application](http://buzzword-bingo-elm.cfapps.io/)

    * View function gets a reference to the address to send all actions to. No need to
        set up callbacks. The Global Event Dispatcher takes care of that for you.
    * HTML generated by calling functions. This is similar to JSX in React except
        JSX has an additional step of translation to Javascript function.
